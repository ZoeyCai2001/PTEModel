\par Cyclists are divided into different categories, such as sprinters, persuiters, time trivalists, and so on. Different types of riders may have different power curves. The power curve depicts how long an athlete can sustain a given power output, which can help cyclists plan their energy more wisely during the competition.
\par There are many types of cycling competitions, but the common denominator is that all cyclists complete the same distance in less time than anyone else. Therefore cyclists are always looking for how to complete a given distance in less time, and how to develop training plans and competition strategies through the power curve becomes increasingly important.
