\subsection{Application of Model}

\par To apply the model to real-world competitions, we construct two world-class virtual time trialists: MTT (Male Time Trialist) and FTT (Female Time Trialist), together with their power profiles. Then we use the model to simulate the process of their participation in real-world competitions. After finding the best tactic through numerical optimization, their results will be compared with real-world competitors.

\par Power profiles of MTT and FTT are listed as table [\ref{tab:pp}]:

\paragraph{} Tracks of 2021 Olympic Time Trial in Tokyo are both around Mount Fuji, and both courses have a lot of elevation fluctuations. The women will complete one full lap for a total of 22.1 kilometers with a total elevation gain of 423 meters[\ref{trackt}], and the men cover a distance of 44.2 kilometers, which is two laps around the women's track.

\par We use the power profile of MTT and FTT, and we apply our model to this course. As the terrain of the course is very undulating, it's hard to ignore the effects of altitude changes on athletes, so we take it into account. With the help of our model, we get the minimum time to cover the distance for to virtual athletes, shown in table [\ref{time}].

\par As is shown in table [\ref{time}], the virtual male rider exerts his strength at the level of FTP in the first 28:41(min), and recover for 21:16(min), controlling his average power output per kg at 6.40 W/kg. in the final sprint, he exerts all effort over the level of FTP, maintaining 7.16 power output per kg, and finally scores 57:12(min). The same goes for the analysis of women, whose power output per kg is FTP, 5.61 and 6.34 separately.
\par In order to verify the correctness of the model, we compare the score of  MTT with that of three riders who participated in 2021 Olympic Time Trial, and find that our MTT and FTT rider rank 7 and 23 separately. As our data simulates the level of world athletes, our optimization results are reliable.
